## Features

‚ò¢ Deeply Reactive, Mutate the State directly !

‚ö° Blazing Fast: Fastest State Management Library !

üòç Dead Simple API

‚ôª Super Efficient : No Extra Re-Renders

#### \+  All the features of [radioactive-state](https://github.com/MananTank/radioactive-state)

<br />


## üõ† Installation

```bash
npm i radioactive-store
```
<br/>


### üßæ Note
 `radioactive-store` is a superset of [radioactive-state](https://github.com/MananTank/radioactive-state). **radioactive-state** is a powerful API that aims to replace `useState` hook, while **radioactive-store** aims to provide both local and global state management. It contains **radioactive-state**'s `useRS` hook for local state management, as well as other APIs for global state management


<br/>



## ‚ò¢ Create global state with `createState`

 create a reactive global state and attach it to window as `window.state` by calling `createState`

Components will then be able to use the global state via `window.state` so its important to create the global state before rendering the App

**Example**

```js
import { createState } from 'radioactive-store'

createState({
  count: 0
})

ReactDOM.render(<App />, root);
```
<br/>




## üìÇ Using the global state in components

global state of app is available not only to component but anywhere as `window.state`

When a component uses **some part** of `window.state` in a component to render UI, we have to re-render that component when **that part** of state changes. To do that we use a `$` function to **create a dependency**

`$` function takes one or more strings that represents  parts of `window.state` the component depends on to render it's UI. This is used to re-render the component when any of these parts changes

#### Example

if `Foo` component's UI depends on `window.state.a` and `window.state.b.c`, declare this dependency using `$` like this:

```js
import { $ } from 'radioactive-store'

const Foo = () => {
  $('a', 'b.c')

  return <>
    <div> {window.state.a} </div>
    <div> {window.state.b.c} </div>
  </>
}
```
<br/>

Note that you only need to include the parts in dependency which the UI ( `jsx` ) depends on not the component as a whole. for example if Foo uses `window.state.x.y` but does not use them in jsx, then they do not need to be included in dependency

<br/>


## ‚ö° Updating global state

`radioactive-store`'s state is deeply reactive and is available anywhere in code as `window.state`. To update the global state, you just directly mutate `window.state` and components that needs to re-render will re-render automatically


> ### You can mutate `window.state` not only from components but from any piece of code and even from browser's console !

<br/>

## üßÅ Counter Example

[Open Live Demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/counter-example-radioactive-store-1yly9?file=/src/Counter.js)

<!-- <p align='center'>
  <img src='img/counter.gif' width='600'/>
</p> -->

```jsx
// index.js
import { createState } from 'radioactive-store'

createState({
  count: 0
});
```


```jsx
// Counter.js
import { $ } from "radioactive-store";

const increment = () => window.state.count++

const Counter = () => {
  $('count');
  return <div onClick={increment}> {state.count} </div>
};
```

 as the `increment` mutates global state, it can be defined outside of Counter component. It's always better to define the functions outside of component whenever possible for better performance, because functions defined inside of components are re-created every time the component is rendered.


### üë®‚Äçüé§ Global Actions

creating actions is completely optional and you shouldn't create actions until it's necessary.

In radioactive-store, an action is a function that mutates the `window.state`. So from our previous example, `increment` is an action


In our previous counter example, I defined the `increment` function (action) in Counter.js but if increment needs to be used in other components, we should store this action globally in window object so that it is globally available just like window.state

radioactive-store does not have any opinions about how you do this, So you can do this however you like.

#### For example, I like to do this:

I like to save actions in `window.actions` and put similar actions together in an object for example `window.state.count` related actions stored in `window.actions.count` object:

 ```js
// index.js

createState({
  count: 0
})

window.actions = {
  count: {
    increment: () => window.state.count++,
    set: value => window.state.count = value,
    reset: () => window.state.count = 0
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<App/>, root)
 ```
And then any component can use these actions like this

 ```jsx
const Counter = () => {
  const {increment} = window.actions.count
  return <> ... </>
}
 ```
